# Puranjay Mohan
Hi, I'm Puranjay — an electronics and firmware enthusiast who loves tinkering with technology and making things work. Worked on different projects involving cross-domain skills like linux kernel development, IoT, Machine Learning, PCB design, and much more. I enjoy solving engineering problems and developing solutions to them using my vault of skills. I love adding new skills to this vault. I live in Germany and work for Amazon Web Services as a kernel engineer. 🚀
